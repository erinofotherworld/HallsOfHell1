# HallsOfHell1
I'm learning how to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. whilst I am learning what I am doing, I am creating a website project as I go. The point of this project was to stress test my chromebook and VS in what I can do with it. The JS is probably not the most elaborate as far as websites go, and I did use the onboard VS Copilot AI to assist in the creation of this site.
This Project contains Music, Images, and CSS, and JS that was cogenergated using Generative AI.
