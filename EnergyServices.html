            <p class="center-text service-description">Usui Reiki is the process of channeling universal energy from the Universe through the practitioner and into the client. From
            there the energy, which is nothing more than an energy boost that promotes a sense of relaxation, calm & serenity while that energy simultaneously promotes the client's body to heal itself in whatever way is needed most. This healing energy is gentle, non-invasive, and works on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels. The practitioner acts as a conduit for this universal life force energy, allowing it to flow where it is needed most in the client's body and energy field. Some clients may feel warmth, tingling, or deep relaxation during the session, while others may experience emotional releases or insights. Reiki is completely safe and can never cause harm, as the energy is intelligent and goes exactly where it needs to go. It complements all other healing modalities and medical treatments. Sessions can be performed hands-on or hands-off, depending on the client's comfort level and preferences. Distance is not a barrier to receiving Reiki, as energy transcends physical space and time.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">Online or Distance Reiki does not diminish the benefits the client can receive. Distance matters to humans - not to energy. Being
            at a distance, or viewing each other over a monitor or a mobile screen does not diminish the benefits nor does it delay the receiving of the benefits that Reiki or any energy healing has to offer. In fact, many clients report that distance sessions are just as powerful, if not more so, than in-person sessions because they can relax more fully in their own familiar environment. During distance sessions, the practitioner connects with the client energetically at the agreed-upon time, and the client simply needs to be in a comfortable, quiet space where they won't be disturbed. The energy flows just as effectively across any distance - whether you're in the next room or on the other side of the world. Quantum physics supports this concept, showing us that we are all connected through energy fields that are not limited by physical space. Many clients choose distance sessions for their convenience, allowing them to receive healing energy from the comfort of their own home without the need to travel.

            <h3><p class="center-text service-subcategory"><b><u>Personal EMF/Aura Cleansing</u></b></p></h3>
            <p class="center-text service-price"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75" alt="" class="decorative-arrow">Basic Aura Cleansing including Chakra Cleansing: $2.00 per minute. 4 minute(s) session. $8.00 total.</p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">The shortest session and the cheapest to offer, the basic aura cleanse (in person if at fairs or events or over distance on
            screens/monitors) uses a piece of Selenite crystal moved over the aura. Since Selenite is a self purifying stone, it purifies the part of the Aura it touches - cleansing it of basic daily muck and energetic debris that accumulates from interactions with others, stressful situations, electronic devices, and the general chaos that happens in this world every day. This quick but effective cleansing helps restore your natural energetic vibration and leaves you feeling lighter, clearer, and more centered. Additional focus to your Chakras is given as well: not just to the 7 major chakras that western society colonized and popularized, but to the full 13 multi-dimensional chakras - the 7 major chakras (Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye, and Crown), plus the 2 chakras below the feet (Earth Star and Sub-Personal), the 2 chakras above the head (Soul Star and Universal), and the 4 minor chakras located in the hands and feet which are often overlooked but play crucial roles in how we give and receive energy.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">Overall even with this session being a basic one, the idea is to offer an opportunity to shine yourself as much as possible so that you meet the day as sparkly & shiny as possible. Think of it as an energetic shower that washes away the psychic grime of daily life, allowing your true light to shine through. This is perfect for regular maintenance, before important events, or whenever you feel energetically drained or heavy.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-price"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75" alt="" class="decorative-arrow">In-Depth Aura Cleansing, Chakras & Grounding: $2.00 per minute. 16 to 20 minute session. $32.00 - $40.00
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">A more In-Depth session that uses a combination of Scanning to determine where points of problems are located. The practitioner gets a detailed energetic reading of your aura and chakra system, identifying blockages, tears, attachments, or areas of depletion. The client is guided to ground using a short guided meditation whilst the use of the Selenite and a focused "scrubbing" removes the muck off of the client. If the muck or problem is deeper, it may be pulled out of the aura entirely, extracted like an energetic splinter that's been causing discomfort. All Chakra Points are harmonized and realigned - not just balanced, but brought into coherent resonance with each other (Multidimensional and Minor Chakras included). Reiki is used to help soothe the points where the added "scrubbing" is done and as a general energy boost to fill in any areas that were depleted or damaged, ensuring you leave the session feeling whole, protected, and revitalized for the challenges of the day.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">At the end of the session there is a free debrief on what was seen, where it was seen, and why what was done was done along with an opportunity to discuss any feelings that the client may have felt throughout the session. This feedback is invaluable for understanding your energetic patterns, recognizing energy drains in your life, and learning how to maintain your energetic hygiene between sessions.

            <p class="center-text service-description">There are many ways in which a Cord Cutting Ritual can be done - from elaborate candle rituals that represent the parties involved and their connection burning away, to a practitioner plucking strings out of a client that connect them to toxic people that do not belong in their lives, or belong in their aura any longer. I use a combination of the two, blending ceremony with direct energetic work. We as humans are social creatures. This sociological drive for community and belonging is hardwired in our brains and our nervous system starting from our earliest ancestors of our genus. In short - it was a survival trait that kept our species alive in a hostile world, ensuring we worked together, shared resources, and protected each other from threats.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">Unfortunately - we still live in a hostile world where we are our biggest threat on an individual and deeply personal level, communally, societally, and existentially. We never grew out of the same survival skills that kept us alive when our species were infants. Our nervous systems still respond to social rejection as if it were a physical threat, and we often maintain connections that are harmful simply because severing them feels dangerous on a primal level.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">When it comes to our energy connections to other people, I think of it like a giant Spider's Web where that connection to a toxic family member or ex-lover or friend turned frenemy is an etheric strand of silk that connects us to each other. Sometimes letting go of that person is enough to drop that connection and the cord withers and falls away naturally. Sometimes it takes a little more effort to truly be rid of them, requiring conscious intention and emotional work. Sometimes, if that connection is persistent and deeply rooted, help is needed to sever the connection for good - especially when the other person is unwilling to let go or when the cord has been in place for years or even decades.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text service-description">That's where I come in; with the finality of severing the toxic and persistent connection.
            <img src="images/DemonCaution.png" width="25" height="50" alt="Caution" class="caution-icon">But: a word of caution - since I specialize in severing the toxic and the persistent connections that linger like a parasite, you
            must make absolutely sure that the connection is one you are wanting, and are needing to be rid of for your personal energetic and mental well-being. There is no taking this back. Once a cord is cut with this level of finality, it cannot be reattached. You will be affected by the loss of this connection just as much as they will, and you need to be prepared for the emotional, energetic, and sometimes physical reactions that can occur. And, as the practitioner, I am using my skills to enact your will - you will take full energetic responsibility for any and all karmic consequences that may come: and consequences will come, as they do with all significant energetic work. <img src="images/DemonCaution.png" width="25" height="50" alt="Caution" class="caution-icon"> See the Legal page under <a href="Legal.html" style="color: #ff6666;">Liability Waiver here</a>.
