            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 20px; color: red"><b><u>Usui Reiki Healing Energy</u></b></p>
            <p class=”center-text” style="font-size: 16px; color: red"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75">Reiki Healing: $2.00 per minute, 15 minute minimum.</p>
            <p class=”center-text” style="font-size: 12px; color: red">Usui Reiki is the process of channeling universal energy from the Universe through the practitioner and into the client. From
            there the energy, which is nothing more than an energy boost that promotes a sense of relaxation, calm & serenity while that energy simultaneously promotes the client's body to heal itself.
            Healing tends to happen when we are in a calm environment, and we feel open and receptive to healing in whichever form it comes in. The energy of Reiki promotes the feelings of calm and
            relaxation, physically, emotionally and even spiritually.
            </p>
            <p class=”center-text” style="font-size: 12px; color: red">Reiki when done in person is traditionally done by a combination of Sigil use and focused laying on hands in the area negotiated
            for the healing session. If the client is uncomfortable being touched, the practitioner can hover their hands over the target location that was negotiated. No physical contact has to occur if
            the client is uncomfortable with the idea of it.
            </p>
            <p class=”center-text” style="font-size: 12px; color: red">Online or Distance Reiki does not diminish the benefits the client can receive. Distance matters to humans - not to energy. Being
            at a distance, or viewing each other over a monitor or a mobile screen does not diminish the benefits nor does it delay the receiving of the benefits that Reiki or any energy healing has to offer.

            <h3><p class="center-text" style="font-size: 20px; color: red"><b><u></u>Personal EMF/Aura Cleansing</b></p></h3>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 16px; color: red"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75">Basic Aura Cleansing including Chakra Cleansing: $2.00 per minute. 4
            minute(s) session. $8.00 total.</p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">The shortest session and the cheapest to offer, the basic aura cleanse (in person if at fairs or events or over distance on
            screens/monitors) a piece of Selenite crystal is moved over the aura. Since Selenite is a self purifying stone, it purifies the part of the Aura it touches - cleansing it of basic daily muck that
            happens in this world every day. Additional focus to your Chakras is given as well: not just to the 7 major that western society colonized but to the 13 multi dimensional chakras (7 major + 6 more)
            and 4 minor chakras located in the hands and feet.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">Overall even with this session being a basic one, the idea is to offer an opportunity to shine yourself as much as possible so that when
            you meet the day as sparkly & shiney as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 16px; color: red"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75">In-Depth Aura Cleansing, Chakras & Grounding: $2.00 per minute.16 to 20minute(s)
            session. $32.00- $40.00
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">A more In-Depth session that uses a combination of Scanning to determine where points of problems are located. Practitioner gets the
            client to ground using a short guided meditation whilst the use of the Selenite and a focused “scrubbing” the muck off of the client if not pulling it out of the aura if the muckleblerg is persistent.
            All Chakra Points are harmonized and realigned (Multidimensional - and Minor Chakras) Reiki is used to help sooth the points where the added “scrubbing” is done and as a general energy boost for the
            day.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">At the end of the session there is a free debrief on what was seen, where it was seen, and why what was done was done along with a
            opportunity to discuss any feelings that the client may have felt throughout the session.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 16px; color: red"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75">Cord Cutting Ritual/Aura Cleansing. $4.00 per minute at 10 minutes is $40.00
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">There are many ways in which a cord Cutting Ritual can be done - from elaborate candle rituals that represent the parties involved and
            their connection burning away, to a practitioner plucking strings out of a client that connect them to toxic people that do not belong in their lives, or belong in their aura any longer. I do a
            combination of the two. We as humans are social creatures. This sociological drive for community and belonging is hardwired in our brains and our nervous system starting from our earliest ancestors
            of our genus. In short- it was a survival trait that kept our species alive in a hostile world.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">Unfortunately - we still live in a hostile world where we are our biggest threat on an individual and deeply personal level, communally,
            and existentially. We never grew out of the same survival skills that kept us alive when our species were infants.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">When it comes to our energy connections to other people, I think of it like a giant Spiders Web where that connection to a toxic partner
            or lover or friend turned friendemy is an etheric stand of silk that connects us to each other. Sometimes letting go of that person is enough to drop that connection, sometimes it takes a bit more
            to truly be rid of them. Sometimes: if that connection is persistent, help is needed to sever the connection for good.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size: 12px; color: red">That's where I come in; with the finality of severing the toxic and persistent connection.
            <img src="images/DemonCaution.png" width="25" height="50">But: a word of caution - since I specialize in severing the toxic and the persistent connections that linger like a parasite, you as a client
            are to make absolutely sure that the connection is one you are wanting, and are needing to be rid of is for your personal energetic and mental well-being. There is no taking this back. You will be
            affected by the loss of this connection just as much as they will. And, as the practitioner, using my skills to enact your will, you will take full energetic responsibility for any and all bounceback that
            may come: and it will come.<img src="images/DemonCaution.png" width="25" height="50"> See the Legal page under Liability Waver <img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="50" height="25">here.
