            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;"><img src="images/DemonArrow2.png" width="100" height="75">From what I have designed this site to be, to what it offers in relation to who I am 
            and what it is that I offer… I am not the easiest of people to know. To some that I know; I am 
            too dark, too intense, too clingy, too trusting, too gullible, too cynical, too bitter. At all times I 
            wear multiple masks and it sometimes becomes hard to know who I am at times. But this is
            the point to why I offer what I do - why I do what I do. 
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;"><i>Come with me into insanity</i></p>
                <img class="center-image" src="images/DemonicSpacer2.png" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">My name is Erin Nyght and I have DID (Dissociative
            Identity Disorder) or Multiple Personality Disorder that fully manifested later in life: and after my 
            nervous system started to relax from a constant “Survival Mode” is when the fracture of all my 
            identities became apparent. I need to make it clear that I am the remaining personality from
            the old system of alternates left after a shamanic healing journey integrated my brothers and
            sisters of that system back into the host personality. But the host personality at the time thought
            it best to leave and vanish instead of finishing her healing journey. PTSD is a bitch.
            When she left, I was the only personality to host the body. To those who knew her: her name was Savanna Tres. But to me, she will always be the period of transition in a three fold journey - out of nothingness.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;"><i>Or a Chrysalis of nightmares - if ye like…</i></p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">As for me: I was the original host to this body long ago. My mind was already fragile and defenseless: I was prone to flights of fantasy and dreaming
            boldly. I loved deeply. I was raised Jodu Shin-Shu Buddhist but left the temple at 13. After leaving the temple I found a book on shamanism that I felt drawn to. My problems started when I
            started practicing the Journey methods: and when I started experimenting with partitioning &
            compartmentalizing my mind so the body can remain functioning in life while I send my
            consciousness elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">Because whilst the body was able to function on autopilot with the consciousness out on a journey: there wasn't enough of me inhabiting the
            body, if the body did anything that needed full consciousness there: which it did whilst I was away.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">Rule 1 of Shamanic Journeying: When in a meditative
            trance the body and mind need to be in a safe location so the consciousness may return to the
            body safely. The body was safe - the mind was not. With that I could not reenter the body - my
            body. I was exiled in the subconsciousness for decades whilst the host that took over my body started to degrade. Remember: the consciousness that inhabited the body was only enough to keep the body running on autopilot. And that autopilot fractured in a nightmare that triggered
            perpetual survival mode.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">Do I know what happened to the body over those lost
            25 years I was in exile - no. Maybe fragments of impressions and memory here and there, but that's all. As a restored host personality whose only been back out since late Aug ‘24, I've been
            more focused on putting the Autopilot personality to bed whilst regaining Sovereignty, Self
            Empowerment and moving on from the Chrysalis of Nightmares that does haunt my dreams.
            </p>
            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">As it is now, I practice Lilithian Satanism, I study the
            Qliphoth, I read the Tarot as a way to gaze heavily into the abyss of my own psyche: to
            understand and to make peace with my rage, my demons and all the ways I wish to scream
            at the world. I sit with the raging inferno of my anger not to diminish the flames but to be
            comfortable with the heat. But in regards to having DID; I am an integrated woman, and the
            only one in my head. But I also acknowledge that if the cards aren't played right: another
            fracture is only a matter of time.
            </p>
<p class="center-text" style="color: red;">So why do I offer what I do? Because I know the pain of being lost in the abyss of one's own mind. I know the terror of
being trapped

            <p class="center-text" style="color: red;">As it is now, I practice Lilithian Satanism, I study the
            Qliphoth, I read the Tarot as a way to gaze heavily into the abyss of my own psyche: to
            understand and to make peace with my rage, my demons and all the ways I wish to scream
            at the world. I sit with the raging inferno of my anger not to diminish the flames but to be
            comfortable with the heat. But in regards to having DID; I am an integrated woman, and the
            only one in my head. But I also acknowledge that if the cards aren't played right: another
            fracture is only a matter of time.
            </p>
<p class="center-text" style="color: red;">So why do I offer what I do? Because I know the pain of being lost in the abyss of one's own mind. I know the terror of
being trapped and there isnt anything you can do about it. I offer Reiki, Aura Cleansings, Readings because they're whats helped me out from the shadows and into self
enlightenment, empowerment, and sovereignty: I offer them knowing that one reading, one session, on kind word of affirmation can make the world less painful. and honestly
I do it for the smiles and connection.
